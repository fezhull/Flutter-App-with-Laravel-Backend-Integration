# Property Management System - Flutter Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the Property Management System (PMS) for Sleek Properties LLC. The app allows users to interact with the backend API to manage property listings. The application is built using Flutter and utilizes BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management. This project is designed to provide an intuitive and seamless way for users to add, edit, and delete properties.

## Features

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- Fetch properties from the backend and display them in a list.
- Add properties with a form to submit data to the backend.
- Edit properties by modifying existing property details.
- Delete properties directly from the list.
- State Management using BLoC for efficient and maintainable state handling.

## Tech Stack
- Flutter: A framework to build natively compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
- BLoC: A pattern to manage state and business logic using streams.
- HTTP: A package used to make requests to the Laravel backend API.
- JSON: For serializing and deserializing data between the frontend and backend.

## Requirements
- Flutter: Install Flutter SDK to run the project.
- Laravel Backend: A running Laravel backend API that serves property data (Refer to the backend [README](https://github.com/yourusername/property-management-backend).
- Postman: For testing API endpoints (if needed for debugging).
